		The Brief
	</h2>
	<p>
		In this semester-long assignment, you will have the opportunity to demonstrate the skills learned in class in a hands-on project. The goal of the project is to build a medium-scale web application (i.e. one that one person alone could not build) that solves a practical problem based on a given brief. In 2018, we want to tackle big societal challenges. The goal is to build a web-based application that contributes towards a solution to one of the challenges proposed by OpenIDEO. OpenIDEO is an online platform for crowdsourcing solutions to worldâ€™s biggest problems. They frequently post challenges sponsored by external organisations, to which anyone can contribute solutions. 
	</p>
	<p>
		Your team will be free to pick from any of the open or closed challenges in the platform and build an online system that aims to address that challenge. You will notice that the challenges are purposefully wide in scope, leaving plenty of room for interpretation. It is up to you and your group to devise a creative solution to this problem and build it. Think of this as a 12-week hackathon, where you will contribute a working prototype of a solution for a real and challenging world problem. The system will be a great addition to your portfolio (employers love it!).

	<h2>
		Project Requirements
	</h2>
	<p>
		The goal of the project is to put to demonstrate what you learned from the subject, namely:
		<ul>
		<li>HTML</li>
		<li>CSS</li>
		<li>JavaScript</li>
		<li>Node.js</li>
		<li>Express</li>
		<li>Mongoose</li>
		<li>MongoDB</li>
		<li>Git</li>
		<li>GitHub</li>
		<li>MLab</li>
		<li>Heroku</li>
		</ul>
		You can use other technologies as well as the ones above, but not instead of the ones above (unless previously agreed with the teaching staff). I am aware that you might wish to develop your project using a technology that you are already familiar with (e.g. python, ruby, etc). In previous years, I allowed it and the experience was negative both for the teaching staff and for the students. The teaching staff was unable to help out when something broke, students in the groups that were not already familiar with these alternative technologies could not contribute to the development, the tutors had difficulty in marking the projects, and it was difficult to assess whether students learned the technology stack taught in class. If you already know web technologies different to the ones covered in class, consider this an opportunity to learn something new and expand your CV.
